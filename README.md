- Tailwind CSS

## AP/AR dataset notes

- Uploads now require a dataset type selection:
  - `AR` = Customer Invoices (Outbound)
  - `AP` = Vendor Invoices (Inbound)
- Validation runs can be scoped to `AR`, `AP`, or `ALL` from the Run Checks screen.
- Exceptions are tagged with dataset type and can be filtered with AR/AP lenses on the Exceptions page.
- AP investigation search checks are configured in Check Builder using `Check Type = SEARCH_CHECK`.
  - Starter checks are auto-seeded and can be edited/deactivated like other custom checks.
  - Add more starter checks in `src/lib/api/checksApi.ts` inside `seedStarterSearchChecks()`.
- AP Explorer uses client-side fuzzy matching. For very large AP datasets, search remains functional but may be slower.
